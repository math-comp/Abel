This repository contains a proof of Abel - Galois Theorem
(equivalence between being solvable by radicals and having a
solvable Galois group) and Abel - Ruffini Theorem (unsolvability of
quintic equations) in the Coq proof-assistant and using the
Mathematical Components library.

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Abel - Ruffini Theorem as a Mathematical Component
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-mathcomp-abel
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/math-comp/abel.git
cd abel
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
make install
```


## Organization of the code

- `abel.v` itself contains the main theorems:
  + `galois_solvable_by_radical` (requires explicit roots of unity),
  + `ext_solvable_by_radical` (equivalent, and still requires roots of unity),
  + `radical_solvable_ext` (no mention of roots of unity),
  + `AbelGalois`, (equivalence obtained from the above two, requires
  roots of unity), and consequences on solvability of polynomial
  + and their consequence on the example polynomial X‚Åµ -4X + 2:
  `example_not_solvable_by_radicals`,

- `xmathcomp/various.v` contains various (rather straightforward)
  extensions that should be added to various mathcomp packages asap
  with potential minor modifications,

- `xmathcomp/char0.v` contains 0 characteristic specific results,
  that could use a refactoring for a smoother integration with
  mathcomp. e.g. ratr could get a canonical structure or rmorphism
  when the target field is a `lmodType ratr`, and we could provide a
  wrapper`NullCharType` akin to `PrimeCharType` (from `finfield.v`),

- `xmathcomp/cyclotomic.v` contains complementary results about
  cyclotomic polynomials,

- `xmathcomp/map_gal.v` contains complementary results about galois
  groups and galois extensions, including various isomorphisms,
  minimal galois extensions, solvable extensions, and mapping galois
  groups and galois extensions from a splitting field to
  another. This last construction is essential in switching to
  fields with roots of unity when we do not have them yet,

- `xmathcomp/classic_ext.v` contains the theory of classic
  extensions by arbitrary polynomials, most of the results there are
  in the classically monad, making the results available either for
  a boolean goal or a classical goal. This was instrumental in
  eliminating references to some embarrassing roots of the unity.

- `xmathcomp/algR.v` contains a proof that the real subset of `algC`
  (isomorphic to `{x : algC | x \is Num.real}`) is a real closed field
  (and archimedean), and endows this type `algR` with appropriate
  canonical instances.

- `xmathcomp/real_closed_ext.v` contains some missing lemmas from
  the library `math-comp/real_closed`, in particular bounding the
  number of real roots of a polynomial by one plus the number of
  real roots of its derivative,
